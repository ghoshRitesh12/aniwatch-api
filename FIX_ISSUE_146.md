# Fix for Issue #146: 500 Errors on All API Endpoints

## Problem Description

The issue reported that all API endpoints were returning 500 status codes with the error message:
```
{"status":500,"message":"getHomePage: fetchError: Something went wrong"}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error "fetchError: Something went wrong" indicates that the `aniwatch` package is unable to successfully fetch data from the target website (hianime.to). This can happen due to several reasons:

1. **Website Blocking**: The target website may be blocking requests from certain IP ranges or server environments
2. **Rate Limiting**: The website may be implementing stricter rate limiting for automated requests
3. **Network Issues**: Connectivity problems between the server and the target website
4. **Website Changes**: The target website may have changed its structure or anti-bot measures

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`src/config/errorHandler.ts`)

- Added specific error handling for `fetchError` cases
- Improved error messages to be more user-friendly
- Added detailed logging for debugging network issues
- Differentiated between different types of network errors

### 2. Retry Mechanism (`src/config/cache.ts`)

- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added configurable retry attempts (default: 3)
- Smart retry logic that doesn't retry on certain error types
- Better error propagation

### 3. Health Check Endpoint (`src/routes/hianime.ts`)

- Added `/api/v2/hianime/health` endpoint to test scraper functionality
- Provides real-time status of the aniwatch scraper
- Returns detailed information about the scraper's health

### 4. Environment Configuration

Created a proper `.env` file for local development with:
- Correct deployment environment settings
- Rate limiting configuration
- Cache settings
- Development environment variables

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/v2/hianime/health
   ```

3. **Test the home endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/v2/hianime/home
   ```

4. **Run the debug script**:
   ```bash
   node debug-api.js
   ```

### Expected Results

- Health endpoint should return status 200 with scraper working: true
- All API endpoints should return status 200 with data
- Better error messages for network issues

## Deployment Considerations

### For Production Deployments

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure proper environment variables are set
2. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limiting for your deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Use the health endpoint to monitor scraper status
4. **Logging**: Monitor logs for network-related errors

### Environment Variables Required

```env
ANIWATCH_API_PORT=4000
ANIWATCH_API_DEPLOYMENT_ENV=nodejs  # or your deployment platform
ANIWATCH_API_WINDOW_MS=1800000
ANIWATCH_API_MAX_REQS=70
ANIWATCH_API_S_MAXAGE=60
ANIWATCH_API_STALE_WHILE_REVALIDATE=30
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up monitoring for the health endpoint
- Alert when scraper status becomes unhealthy
- Monitor error rates and response times

### 2. Fallback Strategies

- Consider implementing fallback data sources
- Cache successful responses for longer periods during outages
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

### 3. User Communication

- Provide clear error messages to API consumers
- Include retry-after headers for temporary failures
- Document expected behavior during outages

## Files Modified

1. `src/config/errorHandler.ts` - Enhanced error handling
2. `src/config/cache.ts` - Added retry mechanism
3. `src/routes/hianime.ts` - Added health check endpoint
4. `.env` - Local development configuration
5. `debug-api.js` - Debug script for testing

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. The API should return proper 200 responses locally
2. Error messages should be more descriptive
3. The health endpoint should provide scraper status
4. Retry mechanism should handle temporary failures gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to a staging environment
2. Test with production-like conditions
3. Monitor for any remaining issues
4. Consider implementing additional fallback mechanisms if needed
